# üè• Ka-Sillag Connect - Main Concept Plan

## üìã **What We're Building**

**Ka-Sillag Connect** is a healthcare management app for Ilocos Training and Regional Medical Center (ITRMC). Think of it as a professional app that healthcare workers can use to manage patients, appointments, and hospital operations.

## üéØ **What We Want to Achieve**

- **Professional Look:** Should look like something a real hospital would use
- **Easy to Use:** Healthcare workers should figure it out without training
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Fast and Smooth:** No delays or lag when using the app

## üé® **How It Should Look**

### **Colors We're Using**
- **Main Color:** Purple (#6c5ce7) - Use this for important things like headings and buttons
- **Success Color:** Green (#00b894) - Use this when something good happens
- **Error Color:** Red (#d63031) - Use this when something goes wrong
- **Background:** Pure white (#ffffff) - Keep it clean and simple

### **Design Style**
- **Rounded Corners:** All buttons, input boxes, and cards should have soft, rounded edges
- **Shadows:** Add subtle shadows to make things look like they're floating
- **Spacing:** Leave enough space between things so it doesn't look crowded
- **Typography:** Use clear, readable fonts that are easy to read on small screens

## üì± **How It Should Work on Different Devices**

### **Mobile Phones (Most Important)**
- Everything should fit perfectly on a phone screen
- Buttons should be big enough to tap easily (at least 44px tall)
- Text should be readable without zooming in
- Forms should be easy to fill out on a small screen

### **Tablets and Computers**
- Should look even better on bigger screens
- Add some extra spacing and hover effects
- Keep everything centered and organized

## üîê **Login Page - What Should Happen**
