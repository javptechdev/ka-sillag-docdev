# 👋 Greetings Component - Concept Plan

## 📋 **What This Component Should Be**

The **Greetings Component** is a personalized welcome section that appears right after the header in the Home Module. It shows a friendly greeting with the user's first name and asks how they can be of service. Think of it as a "warm welcome" that makes healthcare workers feel valued and appreciated when they log in.

## 🎯 **What This Component Should Do**

- **Personalized Welcome:** Show "Magandang Araw Ka-Sillag {First Name}!"

- **Professional Tone:** Maintain healthcare professionalism
- **Responsive Design:** Look good on all devices

- **Alignment:** Centered horizontally
- **Width:** Full width of the container
