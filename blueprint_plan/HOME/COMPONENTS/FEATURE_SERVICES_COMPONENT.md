# 🏥 Feature Services Component - Concept Plan

## 📋 **What This Component Should Be**

The **Feature Services Component** shows the main hospital services that users can access. It displays services in organized square cards with status indicators showing whether users can access them or not. Think of it as a "service catalog" where healthcare workers can quickly see what's available.

## 🎯 **What It Should Do**

- **Show Services:** Display main hospital services in organized cards
- **Status Indicators:** Show which services users can access (Active/Denied/Soon)
- **Quick Access:** Allow users to click and go directly to services
- **See All Link:** Provide access to the full Services Module
- **Permission-Based:** Show different statuses based on user access rights

## 🎨 **How It Should Look**

### **Component Header**
- **Left Side:** "Feature Services" title
- **Right Side:** "See All" link that goes to Services Module
- **Styling:** Clear title with clickable link
- **Spacing:** Good space between title and link

### **Service Cards Layout**
- **Grid System:** 3 square cards per row
- **Card Size:** Square cards (e.g., 120x120 pixels)
- **Spacing:** Good space between cards
- **Responsive:** Adapts to different screen sizes

### **Individual Service Card**
- **Service Logo:** Icon or logo representing the service
- **Service Name:** Clear name of the service
- **Status Badge:** Shows at the bottom of each card
- **Background:** White background with subtle border
- **Shadow:** Light shadow to make cards look elevated

### **Status Indicators**
- **Active Status:** Green badge with "Active" text
  - **Color:** Green (#00b894) - success color
  - **Meaning:** User has permission to access this service
- **Denied Status:** Red badge with "Denied" text
  - **Color:** Red (#d63031) - error color
  - **Meaning:** User does not have permission to access
- **Soon Status:** Blue badge with "Soon" text
  - **Color:** Blue (#0984e3) - info color
  - **Meaning:** Service is coming soon, not yet available

## 🔧 **How It Should Work**

### **Card Display**

- **Status Calculation:** Automatically determines status for each service
- **Permission Check:** Uses user's access rights to show correct status

### **Card Interaction**
- **Clickable Cards:** Users can click on service cards

- **Soon Services:** Clicking shows "Coming Soon" message

### **See All Link**

- **Context:** Users can explore all available services

## 📱 **How It Should Work on Different Devices**
