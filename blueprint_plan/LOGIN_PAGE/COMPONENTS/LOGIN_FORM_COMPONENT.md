# üîê Login Form Component - Concept Plan

## üìã **What This Component Should Be**

The **Login Form Component** is the heart of the login page. It handles the Employee ID and Pin Code input, validates the data, and processes the login. It should be secure, user-friendly, and work perfectly on all devices.

## üéØ **What It Should Do**

- **Handle User Input:** Accept Employee ID and Pin Code from users
- **Validate Data:** Make sure only numbers are entered and limits are respected
- **Show/Hide Password:** Allow users to see their Pin Code if needed
- **Process Login:** Handle the login process with proper feedback
- **Show Errors:** Display helpful error messages when something goes wrong
- **Loading States:** Show when the form is being processed

## üé® **How It Should Look**

### **Form Container**
- **Background:** Pure white (#ffffff)
- **Border:** Soft gray border with rounded corners
- **Shadow:** Subtle shadow to make it look like it's floating
- **Padding:** Enough space inside so it doesn't look cramped
- **Width:** Full width of the container

### **Input Fields**
- **Height:** 48px (tall enough to tap easily on mobile)
- **Border:** Gray border that turns purple when clicked
- **Corners:** Rounded edges (12px radius)
- **Spacing:** Good space between fields and labels

## üîê **Input Fields - How They Should Work**

### **Employee ID Field**
- **Label:** "Employee ID" (above the input box)
- **Input Box:**
  - **Height:** 48px (same as other fields)
  - **Width:** Full width of the container
  - **Border:** Gray border that turns purple when clicked
  - **Corners:** Rounded edges (12px radius)
  - **Placeholder:** "Enter 10-digit Employee ID"
- **Validation Rules:**
  - **Only Numbers:** Accepts only 0-9, no letters or special characters
  - **Maximum Length:** Stops accepting input after 10 digits
  - **Real-time Filtering:** Automatically removes non-numbers as user types
- **Behavior:** As user types, automatically removes any letters or special characters

### **Pin Code Field**
- **Label:** "6-Digit Pin Code" (above the input box)
- **Input Box:**
  - **Height:** 48px (same as Employee ID field)
  - **Width:** Full width of the container
  - **Border:** Gray border that turns purple when clicked
  - **Corners:** Rounded edges (12px radius)
  - **Placeholder:** "Enter 6-digit Pin Code"
  - **Default State:** Hidden (shows dots instead of numbers)
- **Validation Rules:**
  - **Only Numbers:** Accepts only 0-9, no letters or special characters
  - **Maximum Length:** Stops accepting input after 6 digits
  - **Real-time Filtering:** Automatically removes non-numbers as user types
- **Show/Hide Toggle:**
  - **Eye Icon:** Shows on the right side of the input box
  - **Click to Toggle:** Click to show/hide the actual numbers
  - **Icon Changes:** 
    - Eye icon = Pin Code is hidden
    - Crossed-out eye icon = Pin Code is visible
  - **Position:** Right side of the input box, easy to tap

## üîò **Login Button - How It Should Work**

### **Button Styling**
- **Text:** "Mag-login"
- **Background:** Purple (#6c5ce7) - our main brand color
- **Text Color:** White
- **Height:** 48px (same as input fields)
- **Width:** Full width of the container
- **Corners:** Rounded edges (12px radius)
- **Font:** Bold and easy to read

### **Button States**
- **Normal State:** Purple background, white text
- **Hover State:** Slightly darker purple background
- **Disabled State:** Gray background, can't be clicked
- **Loading State:** Shows "Mag-login..." text, button is disabled

### **Button Behavior**
- **Disabled by Default:** Button starts disabled (gray, can't click)
- **Activates When:** Both Employee ID and Pin Code fields have content
- **Validation:** Only works when both fields have at least 1 character
- **Real-time Updates:** Button state changes as user types

## üîß **Form Behavior - What Should Happen**

### **Input Validation (Real-time)**
- **Employee ID:** 
  - As user types, automatically removes letters and special characters
  - Stops accepting input after 10 digits
  - Shows only numbers in the field
- **Pin Code:** 
  - Same behavior as Employee ID
  - Stops accepting input after 6 digits
  - Can be toggled between visible and hidden

### **Form Submission Process**
1. **User clicks "Mag-login" button**
2. **Button shows loading state** ("Mag-login..." text)
3. **Button becomes disabled** (can't click again)
4. **Form processes the login**
5. **Shows success or error message**

### **Success Scenario**
- **Message:** "Welcome back, [Name]! Redirecting to dashboard..."
- **Action:** Automatically redirects to dashboard page
- **Button:** Returns to normal state

### **Error Scenarios**
- **Empty Fields:** Button stays disabled until both fields have content
- **Wrong Credentials:** Shows "Employee ID and Pin Code is incorrect" below the form
- **Network Issues:** Shows "Network error. Please try again." below the form

## üì± **How It Should Work on Different Devices**

### **Mobile Phones (Most Important)**
- **Input Height:** 48px (easy to tap with fingers)
